# Cognitive Robotics - Final Assignment

### Solution by Group 13 - Max Driessen (s4789628) and Jordy Naus (s4722426)

This repository contains our solution to the practical part of the final assignment of the Cognitive Robotics course. 
+ `colour_critter.py` (and the corresponding config file) contain our complete SPA model. 
+ The `Components` folder contains various separate parts of the solution (for testing purposes). 
+ `grid.py` is included in both the main folder as well as in `Components`, as it is required for running the code in this repository (not altered from the original `grid.py`).
